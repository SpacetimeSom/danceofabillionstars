  <h1>Why We Write</h1>
  <p>I have found writing is like meditation. When your mind is overflowing with random thoughts, and you are finding it difficult to live in the moment, taking some time to step back, look at your thoughts, and jot them down does give that feeling and sense of control that otherwise felt elusive. Also, if you are someone like me who just loves consuming information on random subjects, writing is a boon, as it keeps your sanity in check for people like us. If you go through the essays I have (hopefully) written and will be written in the future, you will find them interesting and useful in your life journey. s.</p>
